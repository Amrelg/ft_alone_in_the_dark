# Using Sublime Text on Exams

You may prefer Sublime Text over vim and emacs, and it's possible to use it during 42's exams! However, there's one important limitation: you shouldn't use the "Open File", "Save As", or, for unnamed files, "Save" dialogs. If you do, your computer will crash. Instead, open and save files as follows:

* Run `touch filename1 filename2 filename3` in your terminal to create any files you need
* Run `open -a "sublime text" filename1 filename2 filename3` in your terminal to open your file(s) in Sublime Text
* Alternatively, run `open -a "sublime text" .` to open a Sublime Text window with a file navigation sidebar with its root at the current directory
* To save changes to an existing file that you've edited, use âŒ˜S or File->Save as usual. Just make sure the file already exists, or the Save dialog box will pop up and crash your computer!
